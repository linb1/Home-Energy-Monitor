# Greener Living

## This is the Github Repository for Team 18: Greener Living of the Boston University 2020/2021 Senior Design Projects. The goal of our project is to create a system of sensors that records various data in a house such temperature, humidity and the energy used by different appliances, then show this data in an easy-to-see, intuitive way on a local website.
